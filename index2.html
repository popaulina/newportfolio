		Awesome IT was created in October of 2014. I and two other founders wanted to bring a fresh face to Managed Service Providers. We created a company that brings a personal touch to the IT business, giving every client all the attention they need and deserve. I serve as a CEO and the Director of Client Services. My role is to ensure that our clients are well taken care of and that all tickets that are issued are dealt with quickly and skillfully. I also program on many of the software projects that our company develops. Check us out at <a href="http://ait.nyc" target="_blank">ait.nyc</a>!

		Here, as you may have guessed, you will find some of my old projects. Much of this work was done when I was first starting out with new languages, just to accustom myself with syntax and make something somewhat fun in the meanwhile. The source code for these projects is available on my <a href="https://github.com/popaulina" target="_blank">Github</a>.

		<br><p>A small, insecure chat application with both server and client. Get the source <a href="https://github.com/popaulina/chatclient">here.</a></p>

		<br><br><div class="projects-title">C# - Wantowski's KMaps</div>
		<br><p>A two player game built in Unity. Originally thought up by my high school electronics teacher, Mark Wantowski, this game is a fun twist on Karnaugh Maps - educational and entertaining. (As Unity's web player is no longer supported by Chrome, I ask that you <a href="https://github.com/popaulina/kmap">download the source from my Github</a> to play the game.)</p>

		<br><br><div class="projects-title">C# - Clash of Kittens</div>
		<br><p>Clash of Kittens is a game similar to snake, except with two players and a much cuter premise. Clash was written in C# and also built with Unity. This was my first attempt at working with Unity, and the game was built in about two weeks for a final project. It was created in collaboration with Louis Albano, Cassian Whitehurst, and Mark Koutsantanou. <a href="https://github.com/louisalbano/ClashofKittens">Here is the source.</a></p>

		Hi there! As you very well know, I'm Paulina. I am currently studying Computer Science at the 
		Polytechnic School of Engineering at NYU (I know, it's a mouthful). I'm minoring in Game Engineering and Integrated Digital Media. In other words, I enjoy working with a very wide range of interests in programming. I'm constantly on the lookout for a new language to try or a project to take up. Currently, I've been re-vamping this website, so you may see it change from time to time. 
		<br><br>I've programmed in C++, Python, C#, Java, Ruby, and HTML/CSS/Javascript. I currently am a Student Programmer Analyst at NYU, where I help develop and maintain applications written in C# on the ASP.NET 4.0 platform.
		<br><br>When not at work at NYU I've also got a small MSP (Managed Service Provider) to help run - Awesome IT. Find out more about it on my page for <a id="ait-link">AIT.</a>
